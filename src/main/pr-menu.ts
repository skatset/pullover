 * The card's context menu, top to bottom: opens, then copies, then snooze.
 *
 * Every label carries its own verb, so no item depends on the section above
 * it to be read — which is also why the sections are only separated, not
 * headed. `type: 'header'` would say each verb once, but it draws as a real
 * heading only on macOS 14 and up, and this app still runs on 13.
 *
 * Kept apart from the `Menu.popup` call in `ipc.ts` so the wording and the
 * ordering can be tested without an Electron runtime.
