const GET_INBOX_TOOL_DESCRIPTION = `Pullover's inbox: the open pull requests waiting on the user, grouped into sections by why they are waiting. Call it when the user asks what needs their attention on GitHub, what to review next, or whether anything is blocked on them.

Each section is longest-waiting first — except "waiting", which has nobody waiting and is ordered by latest activity. Pullover refreshes from GitHub when its last fetch is over a minute old, so the list is current as of lastUpdatedAt. When notice is not null, the list is not the whole answer — signed out, a fetch that failed, a first one still running, or an organization that has not approved Pullover and whose pull requests are therefore missing from an otherwise current list — so relay the notice to the user.

Categories, in the order the app shows them:
- needs-review: somebody asked the user for review and they have not reviewed yet.
- new-replies: somebody replied in a review thread the user took part in; the reason says how many.
- re-review: the user reviewed already and the author pushed new commits or asked again.
- my-pr-action: the user's own pull request needs them — changes requested, open threads, new comments on the pull request, red CI, merge conflicts, or approved and ready to merge; the reason says which.
- mentioned: the user was @-mentioned and has not responded since.
- waiting: nothing is waiting on the user — it is on the author or on other reviewers, or it is snoozed; listed only when includeWaiting is true.

Pullover reads GitHub; it never comments, reviews or merges. Act on a pull request with your own GitHub tooling — the \`gh\` CLI, say — at the url given.`
